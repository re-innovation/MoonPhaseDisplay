# MoonPhaseDisplay
A display to show the phase of the moon. Arduino based. LCD display.

This is a simple moon phase display which uses a real time clock (TBC) to keep track of the phase of the moon. 
This can also display information like sunrise and sunset time (this would need location).


##Moon Phase Algorithm
Initial algorithm code came from here:
http://www.voidware.com/moon_phase.htm

Based on Astronomical Algorithms by Jean Meeus.
