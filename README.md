# MoonPhaseDisplay
A display to show the phase of the moon. Arduino based. LCD display.

This is a simple moon phase display which uses a GPS module (TBC) to keep track of the time and date and hence phase of the moon. 
This can also display information like sunrise and sunset time (GPS unit also gives location).


##Moon Phase Algorithm
Initial algorithm code came from here:
http://www.voidware.com/moon_phase.htm

Based on Astronomical Algorithms by Jean Meeus.
